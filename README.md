# Simulation-of-1D-and-2D-heat-flow-using-different-numerical-methods-on-Matlab
Simulation on Matlab of 1D and 2D heat flow using numerical methods and testing the stabilities and different errors of such solutions. Numerical methods used include Fourier expansion and finite differences. Von Neumann stability analysis is performed on the FD solution.
I have simulated a simple one-dimensional, and two-dimensional heat flow problem (Boundary and initial value problems). The solution of the PDEs have been solved using Fourier up to changing number of terms, and a spectral analysis is done to check how changing the number of Fourier terms affects the accuracy as compared to a built in toolbox in Matlab. A finite difference scheme is then used, and a Von Neumann stability analysis is done. The stability of the solution is pushed to the limits predicted by the VN analysis, and unstability is observed.  
The Matlab files that include more technical explanations and the graphs of all that has been done are included in the repository.
