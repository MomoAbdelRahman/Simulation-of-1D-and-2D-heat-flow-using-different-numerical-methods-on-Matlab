# Simulation-of-1D-and-2D-heat-flow-using-different-numerical-methods-on-Matlab
Simulation on Matlab of 1D and 2D heat flow using numerical methods and testing the stabilities and different errors of such solutions. Numerical methods used include Fourier expansion and finite differences. Von Neumann stability analysis is performed on the FD solution.
